Initialization of Min Heap:

A min-heap is a binary heap data structure where the parent node has a value smaller than or equal to its children.
The std::priority_queue is used to implement a min-heap in C++.
The constructor std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> initializes a min-heap with integers and uses std::greater<int> as the comparison function (to make it a min-heap).
The min-heap is initially populated with the first k elements of the input vector nums.
Iterating Through the Remaining Elements:

The loop starts from index k and iterates through the remaining elements of the input vector nums.
Updating Min-Heap:

For each element in the remaining portion of nums, the code checks if the current element is greater than the smallest element in the min-heap (top of the heap).
If yes, it removes the smallest element from the heap and inserts the current element.
Result:

After processing all elements, the top of the min-heap contains the kth largest element among the elements processed so far.
Final Result:

The function returns the top of the min-heap, which represents the kth largest element in the entire array.
This approach is efficient because it maintains only the k smallest elements in the min-heap, updating it as needed while iterating through the array. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log k), where n is the size of the input vector nums.
